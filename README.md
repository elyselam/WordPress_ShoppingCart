Assignment:
Task:
Setup a very basic WordPress/WooCommerce website (we will not be evaluating design, so just a simple basic setup will do). You do not need to fully set up the checkout as the task does not involve payments.

Download WordPress here: https://wordpress.org/download/.

Download and install a local copy.

You can then install WooCommerce (the e-commerce engine): https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/.

Create a plugin for WooCommerce (https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/create-a-plugin/), that will display an alert box when you change the quantity of an item in the cart with the following text:

"You just changed the quantity of ABC to 2", where ABC is the SKU name, and 2 is the current (new) quantity of the item.

Please provide a recording with commentary on how your website works, as well as your code for the plugin.
